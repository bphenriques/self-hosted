# Authentication / Authorization

Using [`pocket-id`](https://github.com/pocket-id/pocket-id) for the services that support OIDC and [`traefik-oidc-auth`](https://github.com/sevensolutions/traefik-oidc-auth) for those that don't.

I will tentatively document the setup process if it can't be done directly in the `compose` files.

# First time

After installing, go to https://pocket-id.MYDOMAIN/signup/setup
