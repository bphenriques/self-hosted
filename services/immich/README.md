# Immich

Opting for external libraries as:
- I want to have more control over the file-structure, particularly, I am fond of having album-based file structure.
- I am not finding Immich mature enough to have full-blown control over the library.

# Setup

1. Set Admin Account
2. Enable `Administration -> Library -> Watch filesystem` and save.
3. Set `Administration -> Server Settings -> External Domain` accordingly.
4. Add external folder to `/mnt/media/bphenriques` under  `Administration -> Users -> Edit`.
5. Go to `Account -> Account Settings -> Libraries -> Create External Library` and add `/mnt/media/bphenriques` as external library.
6. Let's refresh the jobs by going to `Administators -> Jobs`.
